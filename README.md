## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Doing this project I strengthened my HTML and CSS skills to build a component using the Figma designs provided. I also had to use some JavaScript to the theme switches.

One thing I used on this project whcich I don't normally use are CSS variables. I also learned the hard way (Spent a loooong time to figure it out, that if you want to do a a gradient background color you need to use "background" and not "background-color" in CSS)

### Continued development

I'd like to continue fine tuning my CSS skills to enhace the UI experience. I also need to work on improving my use of semantic HTML to help readers understand the page.

### Useful resources

- [stackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/13629204/steven-abaco) - The stackOverlow website helped me with solving some of the CSS issues I had with linking the images to be properly renedered when using the background image for a div, instead of loading a seperate image. I highly recommend developers use this resource.
